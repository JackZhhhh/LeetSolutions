# LeetCode Solutions (C++)

This repository contains my **LeetCode solutions written in C++**, automatically synced using **LeetSync**.

The purpose of this repo is to track my progress, document my problem-solving approach, and maintain a clean archive of solved problems for review and interview preparation.

---

## 🛠 Language

- **C++**

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem has its **own folder**, generated automatically by **LeetSync**.

Inside each folder you will typically find:
- The **problem description**
- My **C++ solution file**

Example structure:
├── 0001-two-sum/
│ ├── README.md // Problem description
│ └── solution.cpp // My C++ solution
│
├── 0020-valid-parentheses/
│ ├── README.md
│ └── solution.cpp

This structure makes it easy to review problems individually and understand the context behind each solution.

## 🔄 Automation

This repository is automatically updated using **LeetSync**, which:
- Syncs solved problems directly from LeetCode
- Preserves problem descriptions alongside solutions
- Keeps the repository consistently organized

---

## 📈 Status

This repository is **actively updated** as I solve more problems.  
Some solutions may be revisited for optimization or clarity.

---

## 📌 Note

These solutions are intended for **learning and reference**.  
If you are currently working through LeetCode, it’s best to attempt problems on your own before consulting solutions.
